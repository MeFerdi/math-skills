# Simple Statistical Calculator

A simple command-line tool written in Go that calculates the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of a set of numbers from a file.




> ## Features


> - Reads data from a file specified as an argument.
> - Calculates the average of the population data.
> - Calculates the median of the population data.
> - Calculates the variance of the population data.
> - Calculates the standard deviation of the population data.
> - Prints the results of each statistic in a formatted manner.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


**Building the Statistical Calculator project taught me several valuable lessons**:

***Code Organization***: I learned the importance of organizing code into logical packages and files. This helps maintain a clean and structured codebase, making it easier to understand and modify.

***Error Handling***: I realized the importance of proper error handling in Go. This includes using err variables to handle errors and providing informative error messages.

***Testing***: I learned the importance of writing unit tests for the code. This ensures that the code works correctly and helps catch bugs early in the development process.

***Documentation***: I learned the importance of documenting code and projects. This includes writing clear and concise comments and creating a README.md file that provides instructions on how to use the project.

***Collaboration***: I learned the importance of collaboration and communication in software development. This includes using version control systems like Git and communicating with other developers through issues and pull requests.

#### Challenges and Solutions

> - ****Calculating Median****: Calculating the median of a set of numbers was a challenge. I overcame this by implementing a simple sorting algorithm to find the middle value.

> - ****Handling Large Data Sets****: Handling large data sets was another challenge. I overcame this by implementing a function to read the data from a file and process it in chunks.

> - ****Error Handling: Handling errors was a challenge****. I overcame this by using err variables to handle errors and providing informative error messages.

> - ****Code Readability: Maintaining code readability was a challenge****. I overcame this by following Go standard formatting rules and using clear and concise variable names.

> - ****Testing****: Writing unit tests was a challenge. I overcame this by using Go's built-in testing library and writing tests for each function.
